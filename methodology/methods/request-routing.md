# Request routing method

The judgment behind `/route-request`. This is the library's *front door*: a thin,
advisory layer that classifies a raw incoming request into one of four funnels and
tells the operator exactly which small input set to ask the requester for. It runs
*before* intake and *before* `/scope`. It never mutates a workflow — it classifies
and prepares; the operator approves; the existing lifecycle commands do the work.

## The four funnels

| Funnel | Meaning | Lands on |
|---|---|---|
| **A — New Workflow** | A new recurring deliverable the library does not yet produce. | `/scope` (which still applies its own reject/defer/merge/one-off/create judgment) |
| **B — Existing Run** | A normal run of a production workflow with new data (optionally a one-time note for this run only). | `/run-workflow` (PR2) |
| **C — Revision** | A change to the *future* behavior of an existing workflow. | `/revise-workflow` |
| **D — One-Off Assist** | A genuinely valuable but non-recurring task. | Do it directly; do not create a workflow. |

## The decision tree

Top to bottom; first match wins.

```
START: a request arrives
│
├─ Q1. Does a PRODUCTION workflow already cover this deliverable?
│       (check portfolio/workflows.yaml for status: production)
│   │
│   ├─ YES ─ Q2. Is the requester asking to CHANGE future behavior of it
│   │            (format, audience, content rules, cadence, review/sensitivity)?
│   │        │
│   │        ├─ YES → FUNNEL C  (Workflow Revision → /revise-workflow)
│   │        │
│   │        └─ NO  ─ Q3. Are they just supplying new data for a normal run
│   │                     (maybe with one-time notes for THIS run only)?
│   │                 │
│   │                 ├─ YES → FUNNEL B  (Existing Run → /run-workflow)
│   │                 └─ NO  → not a standard run; re-classify by intent:
│   │                          a change to THIS workflow      → FUNNEL C
│   │                          a separate recurring need       → FUNNEL A
│   │                          a separate non-recurring task    → FUNNEL D
│   │                          (concerns this workflow, intent unclear → FUNNEL C)
│   │
│   └─ NO ── First: does a NON-production workflow already match
│            │      (status scoping / building / in_review / revising / retired)?
│            │      If so, name its workflow_id + status and route to THAT
│            │      workflow's lifecycle step — never drive a duplicate. A change to
│            │      an in-flight workflow is FUNNEL C (/revise-workflow opens a
│            │      production OR building workflow); otherwise resume its own
│            │      lifecycle (scoping → /scope, in_review → /promote-workflow,
│            │      retired → revive via /revise-workflow).
│            │
│            └─ Otherwise ─ Q4. Is the need RECURRING (schedule/trigger)?
│                 │
│                 ├─ YES → FUNNEL A  (New Workflow Intake → /scope, which compares
│                 │                   against existing contracts and may itself
│                 │                   return reject/defer/merge/one-off/create)
│                 └─ NO  → FUNNEL D  (One-Off Assist → do directly, no workflow)
```

Every path resolves to a funnel (A/B/C/D) or — only when a matched workflow is not
in a state that supports the requested action — to a named lifecycle step for that
existing workflow. Routing never invents a fifth outcome and never silently creates
a duplicate of a workflow that already exists in any state.

## The B-vs-C distinction (the critical one)

The litmus test is **scope of effect**:

- A change that affects **only this run** is a **Funnel B** run with a one-time
  note. Capture the note with the run inputs; **never** touch the contract.
- A change that affects **all future runs** is a **Funnel C** revision. Open it
  with `/revise-workflow`, contract-first.

When B-vs-C is genuinely ambiguous, **route to C** and say why. It is safer to open
a controlled, contract-first revision than to silently bake a one-time ask into a
contract — or to silently alter future behavior under cover of "just this run."

| Request | Funnel |
|---|---|
| "Here's this week's data, and just this once also add a Customer Wins section." | **B** (one-time note) |
| "From now on the weekly summary should include a Customer Wins section." | **C** (future change) |

## Routing is not scoping

Routing is the fast top-level switch; `/scope` is the deep judgment. For Funnel A,
routing only confirms "this looks like a new recurring need" and hands a populated
intake to `/scope`, which still applies its full five-activity method — including
the possibility of `reject`, `defer`, `merge`, or `one-off`. Routing never
pre-empts that verdict and never creates a workflow.

## Funnel → command mapping

| Funnel | Requester form to ask for | Next operator command |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | `methodology/templates/intake-template.md` (reused — no duplicate) | `/scope intakes/{id}` |
| **B** | `methodology/templates/workflow-run-input.md` | `/run-workflow {id} <input-folder>` (PR2) |
| **C** | `methodology/templates/workflow-revision-request.md` | `/revise-workflow {id}` |
| **D** | `methodology/templates/one-off-assist-request.md` | do directly — no workflow |

Everyone starts at the tiny universal `methodology/templates/front-door-request.md`
(~5 questions); the funnel-specific form is requested only if the front door leaves
required inputs missing.

## Worked examples

| Incoming request | Funnel | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Every Friday I need a one-page summary of the team's status updates." | **A** | No production workflow yet; recurring. → `/scope`. |
| "Here are this week's three updates — can you do the Friday summary?" | **B** | `weekly-status-summary` is production; new data, normal run. |
| "Here's this week's data, and just this once also add a Customer Wins section." | **B** | Existing run + one-time note (change is for this run only). |
| "From now on the weekly summary should include a Customer Wins section." | **C** | Existing workflow; change to all future runs. → `/revise-workflow`. |
| "The weekly summary should go to the exec list instead of the team." | **C** | Future audience change. |
| "Can you draft a one-time board memo from these notes by Thursday?" | **D** | Not recurring; do it directly, no workflow. |
| "We keep needing ad-hoc competitive teardowns, roughly monthly." | **A** | Recurring → intake → `/scope` (which may decide merge/create). |

## Guardrails

1. Routing is **advisory and non-mutating**. It never creates, runs, revises, or
   promotes anything, and never writes inside `workflows/`.
2. It writes only three output files into the request folder:
   `recommended_funnel.md`, `missing_info.md`, `next_action.md`.
3. Confirm the matched workflow is in a state that supports the requested action
   before recommending it. **B requires `status: production`** — you cannot run a
   workflow that is not in production. **C requires `status: production` or
   `building`** — matching `/revise-workflow`, which opens either for revision. If
   the matched workflow is in any other state (or does not exist), say so and route
   to the appropriate lifecycle step instead; never drive a duplicate.
4. It respects sensitivity. If the request involves `confidential` or `restricted`
   data, flag the data-handling requirement and remind that raw content stays out
   of committed files, per `methodology/methods/sensitivity-policy.md`.
5. When B-vs-C is ambiguous, route to **C** and explain why.
6. Missing fields are never a blocker — routing still classifies, then lists what
   to request (same philosophy as `/scope`).
